# Overtime

A game made for the RGDA Learn.Build.Play! gamedev competition.

Inspired by the likes of Hotline Miami and SUPERHOT, Overtime places the player in an assassin's simulation. Make use of the environment and your cunning wits to complete each and every contract, despite The Overseer's attempts to thwart your plans.
